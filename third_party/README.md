sapi 4.0 speech.h Header in include
dependencies contains the sapi4sdk, runtime and flextalk
SDK is for completeness, running NetTTS only requires the runtime and flextalk to be installed.

FlexTalk is property of AT&T and was distributed for public use for the last 30 odd years.
SAPI 4.0 API and Headers are property of Microsoft.

I do not claim ownership or credit for these things, I share them purely in the public interest decades after their owners stopped supporting them.
